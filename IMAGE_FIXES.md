# Frontend Image Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Image Sizing Problems**
- **Problem**: Images were displaying in full screen or inconsistent sizes
- **Solution**: 
  - Standardized image sizing across components
  - Set consistent `max-h-96` constraint for all post images
  - Used proper responsive classes (`w-full h-auto`)

### 2. **Image Display When No Image Exists**
- **Problem**: Images were being rendered even when no image URL was provided
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper conditional rendering with `{post.img && post.img.trim() && (...)}`
  - This ensures images only display when there's actually an image URL

### 3. **Container Layout Issues**
- **Problem**: Layout containers were causing overflow issues
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `overflow-hidden` from main container
  - Simplified container classes for better responsiveness
  - Added proper flex constraints

## Changes Made:

### `/src/app/[username]/status/[postId]/page.tsx`:
- ✅ Fixed image container sizing
- ✅ Added proper conditional rendering for images and videos
- ✅ Improved layout constraints
- ✅ Added `priority` loading for main post images

### `/src/components/Post.tsx`:
- ✅ Added string trimming checks for image URLs
- ✅ Standardized image sizing with feed posts
- ✅ Added `loading="lazy"` for better performance
- ✅ Improved conditional rendering

### `/src/app/globals.css`:
- ✅ Already had proper image constraints (`max-width: 100%`)

## Image Display Standards:
- **Width**: `w-full` (responsive to container)
- **Height**: `h-auto` (maintains aspect ratio)
- **Max Height**: `max-h-96` (384px maximum)
- **Object Fit**: `object-cover` (proper image scaling)
- **Border**: `border border-borderGray` for consistency
- **Border Radius**: `rounded-xl` for modern look

## Benefits:
1. **Consistent Sizing**: All images now display at the same maximum size
2. **No Phantom Images**: Images only show when they actually exist
3. **Better Performance**: Lazy loading and proper image optimization
4. **Responsive Design**: Images scale properly on all screen sizes
5. **Clean Layout**: No more fullscreen image issues

## Testing:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Proper conditional rendering
- ✅ Consistent styling across components

Your image display issues should now be resolved!
